In collaboration with a higher-level project based on microservices, it uses the advantages of blockchain to increase the security and transparency of files. Uplovely is an important part of this vision.</p><h2 id="my-role-at-uplovely-as-a-designer-and-developer" tabindex="-1">My role at Uplovely as a designer and developer <a class="header-anchor" href="#my-role-at-uplovely-as-a-designer-and-developer" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;My role at Uplovely as a designer and developer&quot;">​</a></h2><p>At Uplovely I worked as a designer and frontend developer. I was responsible for all UI/UX design to create a user-friendly and responsive user interface. This meant that I had to communicate closely with the development team to ensure that the design reflected the functionality of the product.</p><p>After the design was conceived and approved, I was responsible for implementing the project in AngularJS. As a developer, my job was to ensure that the final product was optimal, performant and scalable. Throughout the entire process, I was always focused on improving the user experience and design of the product.</p><h2 id="the-web-app-for-secure-and-trustworthy-file-verification" tabindex="-1">The web app for secure and trustworthy file verification <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-web-app-for-secure-and-trustworthy-file-verification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The web app for secure and trustworthy file verification&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Using Uplovely ensures the authenticity of files by checking them for authenticity and immutability. Once a file is stored on the blockchain, it can no longer be edited or manipulated. This means that any change to the file will be recognized immediately and will not be recognized as the original version. In this way, Uplovely can make an important contribution to securing confidential information, e.g. contractual agreements or official documents.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="uplovelyAnimation"></p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Features&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="input-switcher" tabindex="-1">Input Switcher <a class="header-anchor" href="#input-switcher" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Input Switcher&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Uplovely allows uploading files or direct hashcode input with an easy-to-use toggle feature.
